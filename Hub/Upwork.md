# Surface mounted Bluetooth / USB Charging PCB Design

I'm looking for a connectivity PCB with nRF52840 that routes commands and images between a separate PCB and external
systems over USB and Bluetooth. It also plays audio over an I2S speaker(s).

It consists of a single board. [Hub Board](./HUB_BOARD.md)


You will,

* Design diagram for the board
* Review the chosen components
* Review the designs for future European compliance application
* Review suggestions with PO before finishing
* List BoM
* Plan ways to quality test the board
* Consider design improvements towards assembly and production
* Produce a small test batch with PCBWay or JCLPCB (White 1mm)
* Deliver test PCBs with mounted components & design files

It's all in a private GitHub repo. At the end I'd want to check design files into the repo.
I will want to have design files in addition to manufacturing files that can be used for future
revisions. They must be in a format(or alternate format) that can be revised by low cost software.
