# Production

We ready to order the PCB and the price is about 771$, we may order it and you will compensate the cost in the future when you will have time, but I need approval from you to order.



Yes I will send 2 PCB to you, one I will left for me if we will need to figure out any issue, after you check it and they will work proper I may send it also to you but later.

For this moment I did the aditional wires and fixture for testing the PCB works, you may see them on the photo. I will sent 1 set to you, but for the first testing of the PCB you will need to buy 2 things:

1. MAX77860EVKIT https://eu.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Maxim-Integrated/MAX77860EVKIT?qs=%2Fha2pyFadugu5ENo7u8%252Bdppd4Gve%2FW8UUp7YZHVw1aMOk8bUTI3KwQ%3D%3D - this one you need to have access to the MAX77860 registers for configuration it.
2. Battery with 3 wires - i can't send you the battery, the post companny doeasn't allow me to do this. You may buy it here: I will prepare wires to connect it. https://www.ebay.com/itm/184854611075?hash=item2b0a318483:g:NuoAAOSw2QxcmEug - you may buy anywhere, but then please share link with me I will prepare wires for easily connect the battery.

For this moment, charger work and USB2.0, I need to check the USB3.0 and the max load current capabilities.

I will add the manufacturing cost(804$) offline in the Upwork.
